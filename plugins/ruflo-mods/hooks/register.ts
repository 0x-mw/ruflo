/**
 * ruflo as a Claude Code mod (ADR-404).
 *
 * In-process equivalents of the classic hook-handler.cjs events that fire on
 * every prompt and every edit, tighten-only tool checks, the cost ladder, the
 * `$.ruflo` noun other mods compose with, and the mod trust gate. Additive
 * and opt-in: the classic hooks stay the default, keep every event the mod
 * does not own, and take everything back whenever the mod is not loaded.
 *
 * Registration order is nesting order (the first registered wraps the rest):
 * the trust gate first, so it judges modules before anything else of ours runs.
